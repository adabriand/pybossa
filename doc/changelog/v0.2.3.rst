================

The most interesting changes are the following:

 * CKAN backend performance improvements: polling now with JavaScript

   every task.
 * Refactor API and add three new endpoints: globalstats, user and token.
 * Allow admins to download a list of users in CSV/JSON format.
 * Fix CKAN key uniqueness in DB.
 * Load 20 apps per page (customized in the settings page).

 * Use Markdown as default for App's long description field (with migration
   script for older versions).
 * Add a simple blog for each app where the owner can share its progress with
   the users.
 * Passwords in apps: the owner of the app can set a password so both anonymous
   and authenticated users are required to know it if they want to contribute to
   the app.
